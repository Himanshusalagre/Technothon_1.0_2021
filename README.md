## Detailed Explanation of the Idea : 
The main goal of the project is to create advancement in E- Learning.
The main problem that the educational system is facing is how to provide practical knowledge through E-learning.

## Solution provided : 
Code Labs is a real-time interactive web-based lab made for students & teachers. On codelabs students can practice live programming and teachers can monitor them. 
This is very necessary in this era of pandemic where even education is being pushed all online.

* Code Labs have the following features:

 1) Create room: The admin (teacher) creates a room with a secret link and password.

 2) Join the room: Participants who have the link and password can enter the room and complete their programming tasks, assigned by teachers.

 3) Code Editor: This code editor supports 4 major programming languages: C, C++, Java, and Python. It also has the enter, exit, run, and Submit functions.

 4) Real-time live coding: In real time, the admin(teacher) can manage the room, guide and verify each student's specific code.

 5) Check the code: after sending the code, Admin can download the sent code as a pdf.
